# titanic-project
Given some data of 891 people in training set . This project predict the survival of other 418 peoples given in test set.
 Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
 The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this challenge, we will build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
after final model we can submit our data in csv format in kaggle.
